# About Us

Applied Computing Research Labs (ACRL) is a small business formed in 2023 by David R. Morrison;
we use advanced algorithms, applied mathematics, and machine learning techniques to solve some of
the hardest problems in computer science today.  We are particularly focused on scheduling and
optimization for distributed systems at scale, and have extensive experience with running such
systems as Kubernetes in production.  We believe that people come first, and have a strong
commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.  We are an open-source-first company; our work is,
and will always be, available and open to all!
