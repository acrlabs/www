# Public ACRL Sites

`www` is the repo for the following public ACRL sites 
- [ACRL](http://appliedcomputing.io) - home of Applied Computing Research Labs
- [SimKube](http://simkube.dev/) - home of SimKube

Both sites are:
- built into static assets using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for static site generation
- automatically re-deployed via a GitHub action on successful merges to the `master` branch


## Getting Started

   ```

3. Run the `serve` command:

   ```

   Replace `{site}` with either `acrl` (for ACRL site) or `simkube` (for SimKube site), example:
    ```sh
   just serve acrl
