Hi, all!  Quick update today---I'm going to go over some of the charitable contributions that ACRL has made over the
last few weeks.  I debated for a bit whether to even make this post, but I think transparency around these topics is
important, particularly in 2025.  So here's a short list of organizations that I've sponsored through my business and
why:

* [NorCal Resist](https://www.norcalresist.org/index.html): In an ideal world, this organization wouldn't exist, much
  less need money, but we don't live in an ideal world.  The current US administration is launching an all-out war
  against immigrants and people of color, and this has a direct impact on a) people's livelihoods and basic human
  decency, and b) the state of science and technology in America, because guess what?  A lot of science is done by
  immigrants.  I've said before that the very act of "owning a business" is political, and I believe it would be
  irresponsible of me to own a business and not take a political stand against mass deportation and mistreatment of our
  fellow human beings.
* Ten of the top [HBCUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hbcu): Several months ago, [Mekka Okereke](https://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke),
  a Black technologist at Google that I respect and follow on BlueSky/Mastodon posted that he made a donation to every
  single HBCU in the country.  I was really inspired by this, and have wanted to follow along in his footsteps; after
  all, "Black Lives Matter" is at the bottom of every page on my website, and also in my email footer, but that doesn't
  mean a whole lot by itself.  I don't have the resources (yet) to donate to _every_ HBCU, so I reached out to Mekka and
  asked for his ranking of the "top 10"---he graciously responded, and I'm re-sharing the list here in case anyone else
  would like to join me:

    * [Hampton](https://home.hamptonu.edu)
    * [Howard](https://howard.edu)
    * [Spelman](https://www.spelman.edu)
    * [Clark Atlanta](https://www.cau.edu)
    * [Florida A&M University (FAMU)](https://www.famu.edu)
    * [Morehouse](https://morehouse.edu)
    * [Jackson State](https://www.jsums.edu)
    * [Fisk](https://www.fisk.edu)
    * [Grambling](https://www.gram.edu)
    * [North Carolina A&T](https://ncat.edu/index.php)

  Where possible I targeted my donations to the Computer Science or Computer Engineering departments.  I went back and
  forth on whether I should be less specific in my donations, because CS departments (and science departments in
  general) are much better-funded than other fields, but finally decided that ACRL's goals here are to support Black
  technologists in CS and related fields.

* [In progress] KubeCon or a related conference attendance scholarship: last year, ACRL sponsored scholarships for
  [The Diana Initiative](https://www.dianainitiative.org) which is a diversity-oriented conference co-located-ish with
  DEFCON.  I thought (and still think) that's a valuable organization to support, but this year wanted to focus on a
  venue that is slightly more directly aligned with the work that ACRL does.  So I'm currently chatting with some folks
  at CNCF about scholarship opportunities for KubeCon, or if that doesn't work out I'm going to look for a different and
  related venue that I can help support.

So that's it---there's probably a lot you can say about the organizations I'm choosing to support, but my broader aim
here is to encourage you to follow along with me.  In a time when science and technology research, along with just, you
know, basic humanity, is under direct assault by the federal government, these types of organizations need financial
support more than ever.  So maybe the list of places I supported aren't the places _you_ would necessarily support, but
I'd really encourage you to support _something_.

As always, thanks for reading.
