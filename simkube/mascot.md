Despite his name, Mr. Squidler is actually an octopus. An early conflict with a fiendish distributed systems villain
gave him his  unfortunate name, which now causes no end of confusion with everyone he  meets. His ultimate goal is to
track down the dastardly miscreant who  bestowed the sobriquet and exact revenge, but in the meantime he helps people
save money on their Kubernetes infra by running experiments and simulations of their environment.

Mr. Squidler was designed by [Mariana Mejia](http://marianamejiadesign.com/), who also helped with the design for both
this site and [Applied Computing](https://appliedcomputing.io).
