# Why SimKube?
## Stop Guessing at your Scale--Simulate it!

<div markdown="1">

Use SimKube to explore and optimize your Kubernetes clusters in a risk-free environment. SimKube is built to help you
understand and solve real-world Kubernetes challenges before they hit production.

Follow these three simple steps to get started:

1. Record traces of events that happen in your production cluster
2. Use SimKube to create a simulation environment that exactly mimics your production cluster
3. Replay the event trace in your simulated cluster; make changes to see how the cluster responds!

## SimKube xray demo
In this version of SimKube, we've released SimKube xray, which allows you to dig into a trace file and see what's going
on in your simulation in an intuitive text-based user-interface.  Try it out, or watch the video below (there is no sound)
for a quick intro!
