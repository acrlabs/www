# About Us

Applied Computing Research Labs (ACRL) is a small business formed in 2023 by David R. Morrison; we use advanced
algorithms, applied mathematics, and machine learning techniques to solve some of the hardest problems in computer
science today.  We are particularly focused on scheduling and optimization for distributed systems at scale, and have
extensive experience with running such systems as Kubernetes in production.  We believe that people come first, and have
a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.  We are an open-source-first company; our work is, and will
always be, available and open to all!
